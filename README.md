DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is a major mechanism of gene expression deregulation in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. However, these assays remain extremely expensive and they are not performed systematically. On the contrary, pathology images are part of the common procedure in cancer treatment and they are relatively cheap. The goal of this project is to study the correlations between pathology images and DNA methylation. Hypothetically, it could be possible to predict the methylation profile of a patient from the images using deep learning. This project idea originated from Pr Gevaert's group at Stanford who developed a software to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. We will be using convolutional neural networks on pathology images to predict the methylation state of the patient (binary value).
